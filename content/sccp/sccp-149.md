## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the liquidation penalty on L2 to 25%.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Due to the low amounts of SNX/sUSD liquidity on [L2](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f) this sccp proposes to raise the penalty from 10% to 25%.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Raising the penalty will boost the incentive for liquidators to perform the necessary liquidations on optimism and take on the responsiblity of bridging the SNX back to L1 while hedging their long SNX / short USD position.
