## Abstract

SIP-386 proposes to list all remaining markets from perps v2 onto perps v3

## Motivation

Perps V3 on Base has seen significant growth with since its deployment and has scaled pretty effectively. With the fee rebate incentives now live, 
it's a good time to ensure that the incentive program has maximal impact with as many markets available to trade as supported by v2.

## Specification

This SIP only aims to list any markets not already listed on perps V3 from v2, but does not aim for any particular market to be enabled within this proposal.
The enabling of markets (once they are approved) can be done via SCCP on a grouped or individual basis, depending on governance set parameters and risk configurations. 
Note that it is also possible not all markets will eventually be enabled, some may be low activity or no longer meet the the protocol's risk appetite or could be otherwise undesirable markets to maintain (eg: stETH, xag/xau synths, etc)


## Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

- the activation of listed markets
- market parameters
- risk configurations
